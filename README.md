Max 7 patch and assets. Esdras Brutus and Javan Reid

Our Max 7 project is about mixing two songs together and creating a visual background based off of your Web Cam. The beats of the music you fuse together makes the visuals dance with the music. 

Notes:

.m4a files cannot be played.
There should be a music file in each of the players for maximum playability 


Roles:

Javan’s role is to work with the coding and have the visuals dance with the music. 

Joey’s role is to make the UI understandable and attractive.

To Do:

Clearer play button
Flashier slider that fits with the theme
